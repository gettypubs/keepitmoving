    “From Flickering to Light” was a master thesis project carried out in 2014 at the Institut für Konservierung und Restaurierung, Akademie der Bildenden Künste. It was based on *Strutturazione cinevisuale abitabile* (1964), a light-kinetic artwork by Milanese artist Gianni Colombo (1937–1993), now in the collection of Austria’s Neue Galerie Graz, Universalmuseum Joanneum. Malfunctioning technical components restricted exhibition of the artwork. Based on in-depth research into the artist’s conception, the history of the object, and its technology, preservation strategies were developed that focused on the installation’s electrical and technical issues.

## Gianni Colombo’s *Strutturazione cinevisuale abitabile*

*Strutturazione cinevisuale abitabile* (Inhabitable cinevisual structure) from 1964, a light environment by Milanese artist Gianni Colombo (1937–1993), is composed of two perpendicular square panels[^1] fixed to a wall ([fig. 20.1](#20.1)). The artwork is meant to be shown in a small, darkened room, with the spectator stepping into the space outlined by the lights. Short and intermittent bursts of light flash simultaneously on each panel.

{{< q-figure id="20.1" class="float-right" >}}

The structure consists of a wooden frame and eight triangular steel sheets painted black, which divide each of the two panels into eight symmetrical segments that are at a slight distance from one another. Stripes of acrylic glass[^2] are inserted into these gaps. The whole construction is precariously held together, partly with screws and partly mounted with self-adhesive tape.[^3]

Eight candle-shape incandescent light bulbs are installed inside each panel. The flashing of the sixteen bulbs is controlled by four switches mounted on the upper side of the horizontal panel. All four are simple bimetallic switches—like indicator switches—in a parallel circuit. Each switch controls four bulbs independently, which illuminate correlating acrylic stripes (the light lines).

Deterioration and mechanical stress had caused changes to the artwork’s constructional components, and the switches revealed partial blackouts and loss of function. Erosion of electrical contacts led to one light line in a permanent “on” position, and two light lines that slowly faded in and out,[^4] accompanied by a weeping sound. The use of bulbs with lower energy consumption[^5] seemed to influence the functionality.

Several resources were consulted before preservation strategies were developed, including philosophical texts by Colombo, descriptions in exhibition catalogues, and construction drawings. The Archivio Gianni Colombo in Milan was visited, where Colombo’s former assistant Roberto Casiraghi was interviewed. *Strutturazione cinevisuale abitabile* was also compared with an identically titled object.

An instrument analysis of the materials was performed. In addition, a custom-programmed microcontroller (Arduino) with different sensors was used to examine the behavior of the switches. It appeared that no exact and completely regular rhythm, and therefore no perfect recurrent sequence of the flashes, is possible with the original technical components.

Based on our findings, a minimally invasive treatment was developed to preserve the components that help situate the artwork in the 1960s, thus maintaining as much authenticity as possible. The authors were cognizant of its unpredictability over time.[^6] The original switches were repaired, necessary treatment on the frame construction was implemented, and, in collaboration with Neue Galerie Graz, Universalmuseum Joanneum, detailed recommendations for transport, handling, and display were provided.[^7] Also, corresponding replacement bulbs were stocked, for authenticity and continuity.[^8]

This process was an instructive example of the challenges and contradictions faced by conservators: the same title for seemingly different installations and objects; varying descriptions, possibly of the same installation in several languages; the artistic idea versus its actual manifestation; the relevance of construction drawings; the difficulty of knowing which came first, the object or the drawings; evaluating different expert opinions; incomprehensible and unpredictable changes in behavior of the switches over time; and historic value versus artistic intent.

The thesis “From Flickering to Light,” which includes video documentation and art historical research, can serve as a guide for any future reconstruction of the artwork, such as rewiring the bimetallic switches or substituting similar switches or programming. All options take into account the difficulty of reproducing a specific random inaccuracy of the original components.

## Notes

[^1]: Each 1m<sup>2</sup>.

[^2]: 2mm thick transparent acrylic glass.

[^3]: Gaffer or Gaffa-tape.

[^4]: Caused by flickering bulbs.

[^5]: 15W bulbs instead of the original 25W incandescent bulbs.

[^6]: It is not possible to predict if the repair of the old switches will last for the next ten years, or even through the next exhibition.

[^7]: Including guidelines for activation for limited periods, safety instructions, and installation requirements.

[^8]: Because the old switches are very sensitive to changes of consumption, responding with a higher risk of flickering and flying sparks, the light medium is extremely important and cannot simply be exchanged with, for example, LEDs.
