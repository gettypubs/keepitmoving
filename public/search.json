[{"content":"In 2007 the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) launched its Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative to address some of the acute challenges raised by the conservation of contemporary art. These include the immense variety of materials—not all intended to last—used by contemporary artists, the lack of established treatments, and, increasingly, the use artists make of new technologies, many of which are prone to obsolescence and call for new competencies for their maintenance and repair.\nAlthough the initiative includes a strong research component, it also recognizes that one of the most effective ways of addressing these challenges is through networking and the dissemination of information among professionals in the field. One of the strategies adopted to achieve this goal is the organization of focused, singled-themed meetings, which present an opportunity to hear a range of different points of view, compare practices, and survey the state of thinking in the field at a certain moment in time. The symposium documented in these proceedings falls under this category. It took place from June 30 to July 2, 2016, at the Palazzo Reale and the Museo del Novecento in Milan and was the result of a collaboration between the GCI, the Museo del Novecento, the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (INCCA), and the Modern Materials and Contemporary Art (MMCA) working group of the International Council of Museums, Committee for Conservation (ICOM-CC).\nThe GCI has a long history of partnering with ICOM-CC. This is the third time that the interim meeting of MMCA has been organized in partnership with the GCI, and the second time that proceedings are published as a result of the collaboration. Partnerships and collaborations are an important way for the GCI to maximize the impact of the work we do and reach out to a larger audience. We are thankful to our partners, ICOM-CC, but also INCCA, and especially the Museo del Novecento for their contributions. We also gratefully acknowledge Rachel Rivenc and Reinhard Bek for their thoughtful editing of this volume\nAlthough the conservation of kinetic art is a very focused topic, the enthusiasm of the symposium participants demonstrated the continued need for research, exchange of ideas, and availability to conservators of reference material. The GCI is therefore delighted that these proceedings will be made available in both digital and print formats, especially since this is the first time we will be including videos in an online publication, taking advantage of the unique opportunity to present kinetic art as it was intended to be viewed \u0026hellip; in motion.\n","id":0,"title":"Foreword","type":"page","url":"/foreword/"},{"content":" “All of a sudden it hit me why not just movement? If there was such a thing as composing music, there could be such a thing as composing motion.” —Len Lye1\n The word kinetic derives from the Greek kinetikos and simply means “moving, in motion.” Kinetic art not only incorporates movement but often depends on it to produce its intended effect and fully realize its nature as work of art. Movement can be energy, experience, or matter to be composed. Kinetic art can take a multiplicity of forms and include a wide range of motion, from motorized and electrically driven to that created by wind, light, or other sources of energy. It can include light, sound, and slide or video projections.\nKinetic art emerged throughout the twentieth century. Naum Gabo’s Kinetic Construction (Standing Wave) (1919–20), often considered one of the earliest examples of kinetic art, is discussed in two papers in this publication; the lesser known clavilux (light played with a key) created in 1921 by Thomas Wilfred is also discussed in these pages. Kinetic art had its major developments in the 1950s and 1960s, with the groundbreaking efforts of artists such as Jean Tinguely and Nicolas Schöffer, and collectives such as the ZERO group in Germany, Gruppo T in Italy, and Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in France. In the 1960s, a branch of Op Art or optical art, that is, Abstract art based on optical illusion, also started to incorporate actual movement; other artists explored the possibilities offered by interactive kinetic environments, in which the viewer’s experience takes precedence over the object in defining the work of art. Kinetic art continues to appeal to contemporary artists, and more recent creations such as Chris Burden’s Metropolis II (2011), Liz Larner’s Corner Basher (1988), and Leo Villareal’s Flowers 8 (2005) are also discussed in these papers.\nIn contemporary art conservation, much thought is devoted to the reconsideration of the concept of authenticity and to the dichotomy of preserving a work’s original materials or its functionality. The conflict is especially acute with kinetic art, where a compromise between the two often seems impossible: when engine parts stop working, when light bulbs go out, the artwork will stop functioning if the components are not replaced. Wear and tear is inherent to the nature of the artworks and inevitable if they are displayed in motion, and issues of technological obsolescence thwart the most well-intentioned maintenance strategies. To further complicate matters, although parts of an artwork might be deemed “only” functional, strong sociological and historical information and meanings are often embedded in a given technology and its use by an artist. Keep it Moving? Conserving Kinetic Art was an attempt, if not to answer all of these questions, at least to convene a wide range of professionals who routinely grapple with them and initiate a discussion. Presenters from North and South America, Europe, and Oceania gathered to discuss issues in the preservation of kinetic art. Some of the discussions were very technical, but more general and wide-ranging preoccupations also emerged: the role of the conservator; functionality and experience versus materiality; the question of artist intent and artist involvement; the meaning of longevity and identity; obsolescence not only of materials but also of expertise and competence; and the influence of fame, fashion, and market on conservation. While most presentations originated from the conservation point of view, broader definitions of preservation were also proposed in a thought-provoking paper by the Len Lye Foundation. The two keynote articles lay important theoretical ground for the following papers and tackle two major aspects of kinetic art preservation. Tiziana Caianiello focuses on re-creation and restaging to explore the boundaries between interpretation and overinterpretation, while in his paper, Reinhard Bek establishes three main preservation strategies for kinetic art: retirement, replication, and maintenance.\nAs expected, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, especially considering the wide range of artworks and situations included under the umbrella of “kinetic art.” Every decision is a compromise, which means that something is inevitably lost. But of course when the moment comes that works of art need conservation, it is often because something has been lost already, something has changed, and we are reacting to it. Deciding upon a conservation treatment or strategy often implies deciding what is the most acceptable loss, and how to retain as much of the artwork as possible. In this process, conservation emerges as an effort to define, over and over, what a work of art is: the specific work of art in front of us, but also a work of art in general. Each decision, each treatment is a tentative answer to that question. Some refer to conservation as an activity aiming at managing change rather than preventing or stopping it altogether. This especially resonates for kinetic works: Caianiello quotes Umberto Eco writing about Alexander Calder, to define a kinetic work of art as “a field of open possibilities.”2 So perhaps when we think of kinetic art, we can think of it as art in motion, not only because of the movement it incorporates but also because it is art that does not possess a fixed state; rather, the art is in flux, as is our understanding, interpretation, and reception of it.3\nI would like to thank the Museo del Novecento for its generosity and wonderful assistance, especially Iolanda Ratti, collections curator, and Claudio Salsi, director, as well as Marina Pugliese, the former director who initially proposed this collaboration. The organization of this symposium would not have been possible without the diligence and tremendous efficiency of Barbara Ferriani and her studio, especially Elena Calasso. Lydia Beerkens and Julia Langenbacher also contributed greatly to the organization of the meeting. Within the GCI, I would like to gratefully acknowledge Jeanne Marie Teutonico, associate director of programs, and Tom Learner, head of science, for their support of the project. I would also like to extend my thanks to Cynthia Godlewski, senior publications manager, and Gary Mattison, senior project coordinator, both at the GCI, who expertly coordinated the preparation for publication of these proceedings.\nThe quality of the posters and the presentations given at the symposium was impressive, and I am extremely grateful to all the presenters and authors who shared their work during the symposium and in these proceedings. I am also profoundly indebted to Reinhard Bek who co-edited this volume—this project would not have been possible without his knowledge of and enthusiasm for the topic, as well as his hard work and dedication. Finally, I am thankful to the talented staff at Getty Publications who turned our proceedings papers into a functional and beautiful publication: Beatrice Hohenegger, project editor, Jennifer Boynton, freelance manuscript editor, Greg Albers, digital publications manager, Eric Gardner, software engineer, Nick Geller, graduate intern, Nina Damavandi, image acquisition and permission, and TK, proofreader.\n Citation: Lye 1984:64[Lye, Len. 1984. “Art That Moves,” “Considering a Temple,” “Tangible Motion Sculpture,” and “Why I Scratch, or How I Got to Particles.” In Figures of Motion: Len Lye, Selected Writings, edited by Wystan Curnow and Roger Horrocks.

For an in-depth discussion of these notions centered around time-based media installations, which present many issues overlapping with kinetic art, see for example Pip Laurenson, “Authenticity, Change and Loss in the Conservation of Time-Based Media Installations,” Tate Papers 6 (Autumn 2006), www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/06/authenticity-change-and-loss-conservation-of-time-based-media-installations.

Lucio Fontana’s spatial research influenced artists such as Piero Manzoni, Enrico Castellani, and Agostino Bonalumi, as well as groups that sought to upset traditional art practices not only in terms of media but also by stressing the role of the spectator in giving significance to the artwork.\nIn 1959 Giovanni Anceschi, Davide Boriani, Gianni Colombo, and Gabriele Devecchi met at the Accademia di Belle Arti, Brera and formed Gruppo T (where T stands for “time”). They started producing works together, and these where exhibited for the first time in Miriorama 1, organized in January 1960 at Galleria Pater in Milan.\nThe term miriorama, from the Greek myrio (meaning “an endless quantity”) and orao (to see), is the title of the group’s manifesto, written in October 1959 and presented for the Galleria Pater exhibition. The manifesto asserts that reality is an expression of the variable perception of space and time. The traditional idea of art is overtaken: artworks have to be realized in the same material as reality. Movement shall therefore represent a continuous variation in terms of space and time, and also reflect the rapid improvement of technology.1\nThe group’s first environmental artwork, Grande oggetto pneumatico, was produced in 1959 and exhibited in Miriorama 1. Composed of seven long polyethylene balloons, it occupied the entire space of the gallery. The shape of the artwork changed constantly because the balloons were alternately inflated through an air nozzle, and because the visitors had to move them to walk through the space.\nFrom January to February 1960, the Galleria Pater hosted four solo exhibitions (Miriorama 2 through Miriorama 5), seen as a progression of and follow-up to the first show, each dedicated to a member of the group: Boriani, Devecchi, Colombo, and Anceschi. The second group show, Miriorama 6, was organized in March 1960, and it was the first time Grazia Varisco was a member of Gruppo T.\nIn 1962, when Gruppo T participated in the exhibition Arte programmata: Arte cinetica, opere moltiplicate, opera aperta at the Olivetti showroom in Milan, Umberto Eco defined the group as “kinetic” and “programmed.”2 Artists introduced the use of new industrial materials and objects in their works, such as plastic, polystyrene, electric motors, UV lights, and strobe lamps. The aim of their research was to invite the public to interact with the art, creating a new relationship between visitors, artwork, and exhibition space.\nGruppo T continued its collaborative activities until the end of the 1960s, establishing relations with European groups researching the idea of movement, such as ZERO in Düsseldorf and Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in Paris, and trying to deconstruct the traditional art system. An ending point of the group’s activity could be considered 1968, when Colombo won first prize at the Venice Biennale. From the beginning of the 1970s each artist followed his or her own path, often with interesting experimentations in the field of design.\nThe history of Milan’s municipal collections of twentieth-century art dates to the beginning of the century and includes acquisitions, donations from private collectors, and long-term loans. Yet it was only in 2010 that the Museo del Novecento opened as a permanent venue that provides a narrative for Italian art from the avant-garde to the present, with a focus on Milan. When the committee started planning the new museum in 2008, it dedicated a section to programmed and kinetic art that included space for Gruppo T, which was not yet represented in Milanese institutions. Important artworks referencing the visual-kinetic research from the late 1950s had entered the museum’s collections from the 1970s through the 1990s; Colombo’s Strutturazione pulsante (1959), Enzo Mari’s sculpture Struttura no. 386 (1957), Bruno Munari’s Aconà biconbì (1964–67), and Dadamaino’s Oggetto ottico dinamico no. 1 (1963) were especially significant acquisitions.\nThe collaboration of artists, collectors, and archives (specifically the Archivio Gianni Colombo) was essential to attract long-term loans and achieve a panorama of Gruppo T’s work. It was also fundamental for the re-creation of some of the group’s environmental works from original documents such as drawings and plans and with the direct supervision of the artists. Anceschi’s Ambiente a shock luminosi (1964), Boriani’s Ambiente stroboscopico no. 4 (1967), Devecchi’s Ambiente-Strutturazione a parametri virtuali (1969), and Colombo’s Topoestesia (Tre zone contigue—Itinerario programmato) were re-created in Milan in 2010.3 These facsimiles provided a better understanding of the boundaries between a kinetic object and a kinetic space, and they enabled research and analysis of the reaction and interaction of the public with the work of art.\nConservation Issues Kinetic artworks present considerable conservation and maintenance challenges and, beyond the specificities of individual cases, permanent display is the first matter to be considered. The Museo del Novecento is open seventy hours a week, and thirteen hours each on Thursdays and Saturdays. Artworks on view are activated for long periods, and this causes stress to lights and motors, especially to original motors that had not been designed for long-term use. To address the issue, sensors and timers were installed so that the works are activated only when visitors are present and only for about one minute. While has considerably reduced the need for extraordinary interventions by technicians, wear and tear remain the primary conservation issues, especially after many years of display.\n   Figure I.1.

The Museo del Novecento’s approach thus far has been that of preserving the original components by preemptively replacing them with new ones, even when the originals still work. In this case, the overall “authenticity” of the artwork is potentially preserved, since its original components, such as motors or rubber drive belts, are intact, functional, and available for a possible future reconstruction.\nThis approach was used during the restoration of Colombo’s Strutturazione pulsante, a work composed of rectangular modular polystyrene panels combined orthogonally; behind the panels, a motor-driven system of slats produces the alternating movement of the panels (fig. I.1). In conjunction with a cleaning of the polystyrene parts, the museum decided, with the approval of the Archivio Gianni Colombo, to replace the two still functional but very fragile plastic silicon belts (from the late 1950s) with new belts. The original belts were preserved in the archive, so the artwork could possibly be rebuilt with its original components in the future.\nPreventive substitution was also adopted for Anceschi’s Struttura tricroma (1964), a work composed of four motorized cubes and three halogen lamps. The back projection, made by the lamps, creates a regular pattern of colored circles on the “screen” of the cubes’ faces (fig. I.2). The four electromechanical 220V motors—one for each cube—were constantly under stress because the rotating blades, which produce the movement of the colored circles, were too heavy. The blades have been preventively replaced with new blades that are lighter in weight.\nSo far, the museum has limited its substitution of components to those that can be considered “tools” necessary for the artwork’s function but not “constitutive” of the artwork’s aesthetic value. For display, the focus is on the historical value of the object and respect for its components. Other specific conservation strategies, such as emulation, have been adopted for environmental installations. Although the 2010 reconstruction of Anceschi’s Ambiente a shock luminosi (fig. I.3) followed the original drawings of 1964 in terms of space and general setup, the artist and the curator decided during the planning process to use strobe lights, which did not exist when the work was conceived. This choice was made because the artist preferred the public’s response to the environment rather than a reconstruction completely faithful to the original.\n  Figure I.3.

Preserving kinetic artworks also requires interdisciplinary teamwork: the knowledge required to understand these works often goes beyond the traditional training of curators and conservators. Since its inception, the Museo del Novecento has collaborated with Attitudine Forma, a company providing technical services for contemporary art that, since 1996, has worked with the most important museums and institutions in Italy, as well as with several international artists. The company, and in particular Roberto Dipasquale, was involved in the production of the environments and is in charge, together with the collection curator, of the monitoring and preventive conservation program.\nExhibiting these “spaces/environments” also has a consequence in everyday museum life. Some issues that don’t directly relate to the artworks’ state of conservation nevertheless enter the realm of preservation, as they can change the perception of the work or can alter the artist’s intention. If, in traditional artworks, issues of safety and accessibility may not be an immediate concern, they play a role in kinetic environments, where visitors must sign a release form before entering a space that could be dangerous for those with heart conditions or epilepsy. Accessibility is an issue when the disabled are unable to enter the space.\nBeing partner and host of the Keep It Moving? Conserving Kinetic Art symposium was a particularly important occasion for the Museo del Novecento. It was an opportunity to share knowledge and open a dialogue with many institutions worldwide that, every day and with immense professionalism, face similar problems. And, as it turns out, have very similar discussions on if, and how, to keep it moving.\n “Quindi, considerando l’opera come una realtà fatta con gli stessi elementi che costituiscono quella realtà che ci circonda, è necessario che l’opera stessa sia in continua variazione” (Considering the artwork as a reality made with the same elements that constitute the same reality surrounding us, it is necessary that artwork itself is in continuous change). “Consideriamo la realtà come continuo divenire di fenomeni che noi percepiamo nella variazione” (we consider reality as an ongoing phenomena that we perceive in the variation).

It was rebuilt in Milan in 1983 for the show Arte programmata e cinetica 1953/1963: L’ultima avanguardia, and in 2005 for the exhibition Gli ambienti del Gruppo T: Le origini dell’arte interattiva at Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna (GNAM), Rome. The environments were always destroyed after the shows. Davide Boriani’s Ambiente stroboscopico no. 4 (1967/2005) was first conceived in 1967 for Paris V Biennale (Ambiente stroboscopico no. 3) and rebuilt (in the original version) in 2005 for the exhibition OP ART at Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt. It is on long-term loan from VAF Foundation. Gabriele Devecchi’s Ambiente-Strutturazione a parametri virtuali was first realized in 1969 at Galleria Il Diagramma, Milan, and later reinstalled many times with significant variations. The original 1969 version was re-created in 2005 for Gli ambienti del Gruppo T at GNAM, Rome, and at Museo del Novecento in 2010. Gianni Colombo’s Topoestesia (Tre zone contigue—Itinerario programmato) (1965–70) was realized for the 1964 exhibition Nouvelle tendance at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Pavillon de Marsan, Louvre, dismantled after the show, and not reconstructed until 2010 at Museo del Novecento.
