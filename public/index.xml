      <description>Kinetic art not only includes movement, but often depends on it to produce its intended effect and therefore fully realize its nature as work of art. It can take a multiplicity of forms and include a wide range of motion, from motorized and electrically driven movement to motion as the result of wind, light, or other sources of energy. Kinetic art emerged throughout the twentieth century, and had its major developments in the 1950s and 1960s.</description>

      <description>In 2007 the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) launched its Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative to address some of the acute challenges raised by the conservation of contemporary art. These include the immense variety of materials—not all intended to last—used by contemporary artists, the lack of established treatments, and, increasingly, the use artists make of new technologies, many of which are prone to obsolescence and call for new competencies for their maintenance and repair.</description>

      <description>“All of a sudden it hit me why not just movement? If there was such a thing as composing music, there could be such a thing as composing motion.” —Len Lye1
 The word kinetic derives from the Greek kinetikos and simply means “moving, in motion.” Kinetic art not only incorporates movement but often depends on it to produce its intended effect and fully realize its nature as a work of art.</description>

      <description>The cultural milieu in Milan during the late 1950s and early 1960s was extremely lively. Lucio Fontana’s spatial research influenced artists such as Piero Manzoni, Enrico Castellani, and Agostino Bonalumi, as well as groups that sought to upset traditional art practices not only in terms of media but also by stressing the role of the spectator in giving significance to the artwork.
In 1959 Giovanni Anceschi, Davide Boriani, Gianni Colombo, and Gabriele Devecchi met at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera and formed Gruppo T (where T stands for “time”).</description>

      <description>When the intention of a kinetic artwork is its movement, is it still a kinetic artwork when it does not move? Do we “keep it moving” even when motion is detrimental to its existence? The challenge associated with the preservation of kinetic artwork is encapsulated in this simple conundrum: is retirement from movement an appropriate method of preservation for an artwork meant to move?
As first-generation Op Art and kinetic artworks from the 1960s grow older, they are acquiring a historical status due to the obsolescence of light bulbs, electric timers, and motor controls: art professionals can no longer simply replace parts.</description>

      <description>Interpretation and Overinterpretation All professionals engaged with the conservation and restoration of kinetic objects are familiar with this tool: the screwdriver. This paper is about the use of a screwdriver; however, it does not explain how to use it to open a case and repair a motor. Rather, it employs it as a metaphor to explore the boundaries between interpretation and overinterpretation.
In 1962, Italian semiotician Umberto Eco published his Opera aperta (The Open Work) in which he theorizes about the category of “open works.</description>

      <description>Thomas Wilfred: The Unrecognized Pioneer Thomas Wilfred (1889–1968) was born Richard Edgar Løvstrøm in Naestved on the island of Zealand, Denmark. In Copenhagen, as a precocious sixteen-year old, he began experimenting with light as an artistic medium, using a cigar box, incandescent light, and colored glass to create colored projections. Later, when he studied painting at the Sorbonne, he expanded his setup to several cardboard boxes, lenses, and a bedsheet screen.</description>

      <description>The Context of Kinetic Art Conservation at Tate Tate acquired its first kinetic work in 1951 (Lynn Chadwick’s Dragonfly, 1951), and there are now approximately sixty kinetic sculptures in the collection, including mobiles, interactive works, and motorized works. Each artwork has its own complexities relating to display; therefore, conservation needs are reviewed on an individual basis and require a variety of implementation approaches. The following three sculptures highlight some, but not all, of the different approaches that could be applied to Weng-Ying Tsai’s Umbrella (1971),1 based on previous work within Tate conservation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Without loan requests, some of the most fascinating and challenging conservation projects would end up languishing on to-do lists. Complex projects tend to be event-driven rather than the result of strategic long-term planning (Citation: Smithsonian Institution 2010[Smithsonian Institution. 2010.

      <description>Introduction Takis is known for his investigations into the relationship between art and science. His earliest works include bronze forms focused on concepts of force and volume. Later he began his ongoing Signaux series with the development of wind-activated antenna-like structures inspired by radio and radar apparatuses. In the late 1950s he began including magnetism in his paintings and sculptures, employing electromagnets to fix objects in space, generate motion, and elicit sound.</description>

      <description>Srnec and His Luminoplastics Aleksandar Srnec (Zagreb, 1924–2010) was a prominent Croatian artist whose work developed between 1950 and 1970, a vital period for the arts as well as for international culture, politics, and economics. Srnec was a member of the EXAT 51 group, active in the early 1950s, which sought to introduce experimentation into art and based its activities on the theories and traditions of Russian Constructivism, Bauhaus, and Neoplasticism.</description>

      <description>The Latin American department at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH), began collecting kinetic art in 2004, including works by pioneering artists of the 1960s such as Abraham Palatnik, Horacio García Rossi, Gyula Kosice, Gregorio Vardanega, Martha Boto, and Julio Le Parc. They used various mechanisms—mirrors, the interplay of lights, and bubbling water—to produce movement and create both regular and random patterns. These artworks were displayed in multiple exhibitions, which provided challenges in maintaining their functionality.</description>

      <description>Behavioral Kinetics Giacomo Balla’s Bambina che corre sul balcone (Girl running on a balcony), from 1912, is in the collection of the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in Milan and is currently undergoing restoration in Ferriani’s studio (fig. 10.1). It has a direct relationship with photodynamic research on the kinetics and behavior of the body, and the artwork features an experimental technique. Bambina che corre sul balcone is one of the masterpieces of Futurism: the Italian root for the immersive, physical, tactile experience of movement—or, better, of space through movement.</description>

      <title>The Examination and Conservation of Thirteen Artworks by Jean Tinguely in the Collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam</title>

      <description>Tinguely and the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam holds thirteen three-dimensional kinetic works by Jean Tinguely (1925–1991). Created between 1954 and 1971, they provide a clear view of Tinguely’s development as an artist. The earliest work in the collection is Elément détaché III (1954), a very fragile “thread relief,” and the latest is the heavy machine Méta II (1971).
Former Stedelijk director Willem Sandberg and former curator Ad Petersen befriended Tinguely in the 1960s, and they started collecting his work for the museum after the Stedelijk’s exhibitions Bewogen Beweging (Moving movement) (1961) and Dylaby (1962) (Schavemaker, Til, and Wismer 2016:155–61).</description>

      <description>Introduction In 1958, in search of a new artistic beginning—a Stunde Null, or “zero hour”—Otto Piene (1928–2014) and Heinz Mack (b. 1931) founded the artist magazine ZERO, which was later to give its name to an international art movement. In 1961 Günther Uecker (b. 1930) began to collaborate closely with Piene and Mack. They quickly gained considerable popularity through their light-kinetics, and they initiated numerous projects that involved other artists such as Jean Tinguely, Lucio Fontana, and Yves Klein.</description>

      <description>In 1966, Julio Le Parc represented Argentina in the Venice Biennale (fig. 13.1) and received the international grand prize in painting. According to the reviews, his space was one of the most visited.1 As the appeal of kinetic art continued to grow and draw crowds to museums, kinetic artworks seemed to meet the most ambitious objective of the avant-garde: to integrate art and life.
Kineticism2 was an international trend composed of different groups of artists who were in contact with one another, including the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in France, Gruppo T and Gruppo N in Italy, ZERO in Germany, Dwizjenije in Moscow, and USCO in New York.</description>

The New Zealand–born Len Lye (1901–1980) remains one of the most enigmatic of modernist artists. Leaving his homeland in his mid-twenties to seek out less provincial pastures, Lye traveled between Australia and Samoa, becoming familiar with aboriginal and Pacific cultures before arriving in London in 1926, where he was immediately welcomed by the British avant-garde.</description>

      <description>Cockcroft-Walton Generator First designed in 1932, the Cockcroft–Walton generator is an electric circuit that produces a high voltage from a low voltage. A system of capacitors and diodes generates this voltage, along with kinetic components such as dynamos (fig. 16.1), which are housed inside rounded aluminum casings. The machine is assembled over two Bakelite isolating cylinders. The electrical components were lost during the first installation in the museum in the 1960s; furthermore, safety concerns prevent us from activating the machine.</description>

      <description>During the second half of the 1950s, artist Heinz Mack (b. 1931) developed his interest in lighting and kinetic phenomena with his Rotors. This series of works is laminated with shiny metal and creates moving light reflections via movement produced by a small motor housed on the back. Light Dynamo belongs to this phase of the artist’s production; it was recently identified as a work realized by Mack in 1960 for the ZERO group’s only exhibition in Rome: Mack + Klein + Piene + Uecker + Lo Savio = 0, of 1961.</description>

      <description>Meteorological science has documented that climate change has resulted in more storms and increasing storm intensity over recent decades (Citation: Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe 2014[Melillo, Jerry M., Terese (T.

These new weather-related challenges necessitate that new display protocols for outdoor sculpture be adopted by the field, just as recommendations for indoor museum environments were standardized in 1978 with the publication of Garry Thomson’s Museum Environment.</description>

      <description>Gianni Colombo’s Strutturazione cinevisuale abitabile Strutturazione cinevisuale abitabile (Inhabitable cinevisual structure) from 1964, a light environment by Milanese artist Gianni Colombo (1937–1993), is composed of two perpendicular square panels1 fixed to a wall (fig. 20.1). The artwork is meant to be shown in a small, darkened room, with the spectator stepping into the space outlined by the lights. Short and intermittent bursts of light flash simultaneously on each panel.</description>

      <description>Born in Zurich, Urs Fischer (b. 1973) is a prominent contemporary artist who uses a wide variety of media and materials to create assemblages, paintings, digital montages, spatial installations, kinetic objects, and texts. Death of a moment (2007) is a site-specific installation consisting of a wall (13.5 × 3.2m) mounted with floor-to-ceiling mirrors (fig. 21.1). The mirrors perform a regular, barely noticeable tilting motion, which has a disturbing effect on spatial perception.</description>

      <description>Dutch artist Ray Staakman (b. 1941) was a pioneer in kinetic art in the Netherlands during the 1960s and 1970s, and the movement in his artworks creates intriguing optical effects by the displacement of shapes. Unfortunately, several of his works began to malfunction after repeated use and could no longer be displayed. In 2012 the University of Amsterdam (UvA), in collaboration with the Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE; the Cultural Heritage Agency, Netherlands), began a major conservation project of seven of Staakman’s early kinetic artworks in the collection of the RCE.</description>

The Artwork In 2001 artist Joost Conijn (b. 1971) created Hout Auto (Wood Car) (fig. 23.1) from the base of a Citroën DS, building the chassis from plywood and installing a wood-burning apparatus that powered the engine instead of gas. In 2002 the artist drove Hout Auto through fifteen countries in Europe, collecting wood along the way and documenting his journey on video.</description>

      <description>Kinetic art not only includes movement, but often depends on it to produce its intended effect and therefore fully realize its nature as work of art. It can take a multiplicity of forms and include a wide range of motion, from motorized and electrically driven movement to motion as the result of wind, light, or other sources of energy. Kinetic art emerged throughout the twentieth century, and had its major developments in the 1950s and 1960s.</description>
