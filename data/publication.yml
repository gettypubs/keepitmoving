    bio: "Reinhard Bek completed his training as an objects conservator in 2002. That same year, he joined the Museum Tinguely in Basel, Switzerland, as its first permanent conservator. Bek was a founding member of the European Union project Inside Installations in 2003, and he was hired in 2008 by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, to spearhead an assessment of their technology-based artwork. In 2012, with his partner Christine Frohnert, he founded Bek & Frohnert LLC, based in New York City. He has lectured internationally and published widely on contemporary art conservation.<span class='q-contributors__list__item__link'><a href='http://www.getty.edu/publications/keepitmoving/keynotes/1-bek/'>1.

    Kinetic art not only includes movement, but often depends on it to produce its intended effect and therefore fully realize its nature as work of art. It can take a multiplicity of forms and include a wide range of motion, from motorized and electrically driven movement to motion as the result of wind, light, or other sources of energy. Kinetic art emerged throughout the twentieth century, and had its major developments in the 1950s and 1960s.

    Professionals responsible for conserving contemporary art are in the midst of rethinking the concept of authenticity and solving the dichotomy often felt between original materials and functionality of the work of art. The contrast is especially acute with kinetic art when a compromise between the two often seems impossible. Also to be considered are issues of technological obsolescence and the fact that an artist’s chosen technology often carries with it strong sociological and historical information and meanings.

    Presenting the latest research and scholarship on the topic with fifteen essays and eight posters, this online publication (also available for print-on-demand) includes videos to capture more accurately the effects conjured by kinetic artworks.
